    "Now that we have path for our car to travel on, we need a means of simulating cars on that path. We should be able to define the car in terms of constants like acceleration capabilities, drag, size, etc. We should also be able to control variables like speed, throttle, breaking, PRNDL, etc. Notice we will not control direction (that is specified by the path)."
